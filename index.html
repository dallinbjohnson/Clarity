        “We’re on a journey to create a world without language barriers, and our community has been extremely
        inspirational. They shared amazing stories and given us great examples of how they will use Pilot to
        speak with friends, family or anyone in their everyday lives. This is the first step in fulfilling a dream of an
        earpiece which translates everything around you, and we can’t wait to get Pilot into the hands and ears of
        everyone.” Andrew Ochoa, CEO.

    <blockquote>
        Last month, Waverly Labs announced the upcoming launch of the Pilot V1 app (scheduled for release at the
        end of October 2016). Waverly Labs shared that launching the Pilot app before releasing the full
        conversational kit including the earpieces, should “allow our users to become more familiar with voice
        synthesis translation and prepare for the arrival of Pilot and wearable technology”. <br />A press
        announcement will be made later in the month of October 2016.
